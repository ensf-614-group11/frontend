## Steps to Clone and Run the Application

### 1. Clone the Repository

Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/movie-ticket-reservation.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd movie-ticket-reservation
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

To start the application in development mode, run:
```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the application in your default browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

If the browser does not open automatically, manually navigate to the above URL.

### 4. Verify React Router Functionality

The application uses React Router for navigation. You should be able to navigate between the different pages, such as:
- Viewing available movies and showtimes.
- Selecting theaters and dates.
- Booking tickets.

Ensure that the routing works seamlessly in the application.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Common Errors**:
   - If you encounter an error like `npm ERR! code ERESOLVE`, try clearing the cache and reinstalling dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm cache clean --force
     npm install
     ```

2. **Port Conflicts**:
   - If the development server fails to start due to port conflicts, specify a different port by running:
     ```bash
     PORT=3001 npm start
     ```

3. **API Issues**:
   - Ensure the backend API is running and accessible if the application relies on it.

## Notes

- This application assumes a backend API is running to provide movie, theater, and showtime data. Ensure the backend is set up and running if applicable.
- For any additional setup instructions, refer to the project documentation or contact the project maintainer.
